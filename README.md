# One Dark Balanced for Sublime Babel

Atom's One Dark theme ported to Visual Studio Code, optimized for use with [Sublime Babel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshpeng.sublime-babel-vscode) and sprinkled with subtle Sublime/Monokai aesthetic poetry.

This extension is heavily inspired by [Josh Peng's One Dark theme](https://github.com/joshpeng/One-Dark) but deviates from it to provide a more balanced visual context, subtly resembling Sublime/Monokai. It fixes many of the inconsistencies and issues when working with ES6/Babel and improves the coloring of other languages (Python, CSS) to feel consistent with Javascript.

**Enjoy!**
